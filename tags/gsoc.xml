&lt;p&gt;We are very happy that the &lt;a href="https://incf.org"&gt;INCF&lt;/a&gt; has been again selected to be a mentor organization for the &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (“a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development”). As in last years, the Brian simulator project takes part and offers several projects for students/”open source beginners” to work on.
The &lt;strong&gt;application period for the Google Summer of Code 2025 starts&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;March 24th&lt;/strong&gt;, and the deadline is on &lt;strong&gt;April 8th&lt;/strong&gt; (full &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline"&gt;timeline for GSoC 2025&lt;/a&gt;). With this post we give some general information about the ideal contributor application from our point of view. The recommendations we give here hold for all of the proposed projects, but we will also try to give information specific to the respective projects in the corresponding &lt;a href="https://neurostars.org/tag/gsoc2025"&gt;neurostars&lt;/a&gt; threads. For a full list of Brian-related projects, see the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

Changes are quite high that it will be selected, since its participation in the last years was very successful. If this is the case, there will be an opportunity to work on the Brian simulator, please see the list of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19xlhgizLcv5x4kjap3nXoQMTNGnxaV-qiq0vrSe-HMo"&gt;proposed projects&lt;/a&gt; (Brian projects are number 8 and 9). Feel free to ask questions or discuss the project on the &lt;a href="https://neurostars.org/"&gt;Neurostars forum&lt;/a&gt; (find all projects in the &lt;em&gt;GSoC&lt;/em&gt; category). It is not mandatory to work on one of the proposed projects, though, please contact &lt;a href="mailto:marcel.stimberg@inserm.fr"&gt;marcel.stimberg@inserm.fr&lt;/a&gt; if you have an idea of your own.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>GSoC</category><guid>https://briansimulator.org/posts/2020/gsoc-2020-work-on-brian-during-the-summer/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 09:18:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
