We now also automatically push Docker images to &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/briansimulator/brian/general"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;, provide Python wheels for Python 3.12, and build and test on Apple Silicon hardware. The release also fixes various compatibility issues with the upcoming numpy 2.0 release ‚Äì although we cannot be sure yet whether the ongoing development will not make additional changes neccessary. As always, the new release also fixes a bunch of small bugs and errors, and updates the documentation and the examples.&lt;/p&gt;

As in last years, the Brian simulator project takes part and offers several projects for students/‚Äùopen source beginners‚Äù to work on.
The application period for the Google Summer of Code 2024 starts on March 18th (full &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline"&gt;timeline for GSoC 2024&lt;/a&gt;). With this post we give some general information about the ideal contributor application from our point of view. The recommendations we give here hold for all of the proposed projects, but we will also try to give information specific to the respective projects in the corresponding &lt;a href="https://neurostars.org/tag/gsoc2024"&gt;neurostars&lt;/a&gt; threads. For a full list of Brian-related projects, see the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

This release comes with a large number of bug fixes, various small improvements to the C++ code generation process, new examples and improved documentation, as well as a more powerful ‚Äúgenerator syntax‚Äù for synapse generation. In particular, it is now possible to generate a fixed number of synapses randomly ‚Äì either for each pre-synaptic or for each post-synaptic cell. We have also updated our build and testing infrastructure, and now provide binary pip-installable packages for all platforms, including the fancy new Apple hardware. Please let us know if you run into any issues!&lt;/p&gt;

In these articles, I go through a recent bug in Brian (or one of its dependencies) and describe all the steps I used to find the source of the bug and how I fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today‚Äôs bug is about a strangely named file that seemingly appears out of nowhere when running Brian simulations. The final fix for the bug will turn out to be a single character change in the Brian code base üòÄ!&lt;/p&gt;

In these articles, I will go through a recent bug in Brian (or one of its dependencies) and describe all the steps I used to find the source of the bug and how I fixed it. I will try to not only focus on the Brian-side of things, but also show some general tools like &lt;code&gt;git bisect&lt;/code&gt; or ‚Äúmonkey patching‚Äù that can be helpful to find the source of these nasty critters (no actual bugs were harmed during the making of this blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start! Today‚Äôs bug will be about equations, and more specifically about their LaTeX representation. As most of you probably know, Brian can represent equations, quantities, etc. in LaTeX. This representation can then either be included in a LaTeX document or directly rendered for example as the output in &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/"&gt;jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It also paves the way for the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 ‚Äì given that Python 2 is now &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/"&gt;no longer officially supported&lt;/a&gt;, Brian 2.3 will be the last release to support Python 2.
