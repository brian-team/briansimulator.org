If you are new to Brian, we recommend you to use Brian 2, the current version of Brian 2 in development. Brian 1.x is no longer actively developed and will only receive important bug fixes. If you have existing code in Brian 1, note that Brian 2 is not fully backwards compatible, though, see "<a href="http://brian2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/changes.html">Changes from Brian 1</a>" in the documentation.

Both Brian 1 and Brian 2 are available on the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI package index</a>, the packages are named <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/brian">brian</a> (Brian 1), respectively <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Brian2">brian2</a> (Brian 2).
