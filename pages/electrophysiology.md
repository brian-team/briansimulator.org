<html><body><p>Brian includes an <a href="http://www.briansimulator.org/docs/electrophysiology.html">electrophysiology library</a> that you can use to simulate a complete electrophysiological recording setup, including electrodes and amplifiers. In particular, it includes current clamp (with bridge compensation), voltage clamp, discontinuous current clamp, AEC, discontinuous voltage clamp.

Here is some code that complements the chapter on intracellular electrophysiology in the <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/9780521516228">Handbook of Neural Activity Measurement</a>: <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/servlet/file/Code%20for%20Chapter%203%20(Intracellular%20recording).zip?ITEM_ENT_ID=7103843&amp;ITEM_VERSION=1&amp;COLLSPEC_ENT_ID=842&amp;download=1">download</a>.

These are Brian scripts that produce some of the figures of the chapter.
