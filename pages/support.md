<html><body><p>If you are stuck with a problem using Brian, please do get in touch at our email support list: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/briansupport">briansupport</a>.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:
</p><ol>
 	<li>Do try to solve the problem on your own first. Read the documentation, including using the search feature, index and reference documentation.</li>
 	<li>Search the mailing list archives to see if someone else already had the same problem.</li>
 	<li>Before writing, try to create a minimal example that reproduces the problem. You'll get the fastest response if you can send just a handful of lines of code that show what isn't working.</li>
</ol>
