We welcome every kind of contribution. Here are a few ways to start getting involved in the Brian community.

## Publish your code
The simplest way to contribute is to publish the code you used for your articles in a public database
(for example, [ModelDB](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/)). It increases the impact of your work and it is useful 
for the community. Please [cite us](/cite) if you use Brian. We would be glad if you sent us an email when you
publish Brian code, or mention us on [<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;Twitter](https://twitter.com/briansimulator).

## Send bug reports
If something is wrong, let us know on the
[<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> &nbsp;support mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/briansupport) or if you are
very confident that it is a bug, submit it directly to our
[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>&nbsp;issues list](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/issues).

## Help other users
If you are comfortable with Brian, you could help other users on the
[<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>&nbsp;support mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/briansupport). If you solved a
non-trivial problem, such as installing Brian on an iPhone, you could also post a message explaining how you did it.

##Contribute new features or bug fixes
If you are very confident with Brian and happy to get deep into the source code, take a look at our
[developer pages](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/index.html) and
[coding guidelines](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer/guidelines/index.html), and send us a
[<i class="fab fa-github"></i>&nbsp;pull request](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pulls).

## Contribute to external libraries
A great way to help us is to write or contribute to external libraries that either build on Brian or are useful for
neural simulation. Take a look at [what other people have done](/ecosystem).

## Tell us what you would like to see in Brian
Help us prioritize the future features by telling us what is most important to you, either via the
[<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>&nbsp;development mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/brian-development) or on
[<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;Twitter](https://twitter.com/briansimulator).
