        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
            In 1952 Hodgkin and Huxley simulated their model of the squid giant axon. It took them three weeks using a
            hand operated  Brunsviga mechanical calculator. Fortunately, you don't have to wait that long. Brian can
            simulate thousands of neurons in realtime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brian uses <emph>runtime code generation</emph> for state of the art performance, automatically converting
            your equations into low level C++ code, compiling and running them without any user input required.
