        <p>
            Brian is more than ten years old, so you can rely on it giving accurate results. We have an extensive
            test suite that catches any bugs and makes sure that it runs on all platforms. We continue working on
            Brian, releasing a new version about every six months.
        </p>

            And, we help you to make sure that your code doesn't have bugs. If you try to write a dimensionally
            inconsistent equation, we'll tell you. If the solver you specified for your differential equations is
            unstable, we'll let you know.
