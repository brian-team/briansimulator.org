Happy New Year to all Brian users {{% emoji party_popper %}}! We are happy to announce a new release, **Brian 2.3**. This release fixes a number of bugs and introduces some new features. It also paves the way for the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 â€“ given that Python 2 is now [no longer officially supported](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), Brian 2.3 will be the last release to support Python 2. For a full list of changes, see the [release notes](http://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.3/introduction/release_notes.html). We recommend all users of Brian 2 to update.

Brian 2 can be installed with Anaconda from the [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/brian2) (packages are provided for Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8), or with pip from the [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/Brian2/).

As always, please report bugs or suggestions to the [github bug tracker](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/issues) or to the [brian-development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brian-development) ([brian-development@googlegroups.com](mailto:brian-development@googlegroups.com)).
