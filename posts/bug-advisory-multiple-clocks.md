<html><body><p>We recently found and fixed a bug which may silently cause spikes to be lost or extra spikes to be generated in certain circumstances. At the moment, the only known example of a problem is when using SpikeGeneratorGroup in a simulation with multiple clocks as in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/briansupport/browse_thread/thread/98151b5f340c33b0?hl=en">this message on the support group</a>, but the problem may also appear in rare situations with other simulations with multiple clocks. We advise users to upgrade to Brian 1.1.4 when it is released next week.</p></body></html>
