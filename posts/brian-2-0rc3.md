<html><body><p>We are happy to announce the release of <strong>Brian 2.0rc3</strong>. This release fixes several bugs, in particular related to long-running simulations (a memory leak and the inability to configure the logging system). ItÂ  also improves the random number generation mechanism (same high-quality random numbers in C++ standalone as in runtime mode; new seed function to get reproducible random numbers). See the <a href="http://brian2.readthedocs.org/en/2.0rc3/introduction/release_notes.html">release notes</a> for more information and other changes.
