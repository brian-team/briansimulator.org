<html><body><p>We are organizing a competition, the "Brian twister": write an example script for the Brian simulator and win a Brian mug!
A winning entry:
</p><ul>
	<li>is short and self-consistent</li>
	<li>is easy to read</li>
	<li>does something cool (e.g. something related to a paper)</li>
</ul>
For example, this short script simulates a synfire chain (Diesmann et al., 1999):
<a href="http://www.briansimulator.org/docs/examples-frompapers_Diesmann_et_al_1999.html">http://www.briansimulator.org/docs/examples-frompapers_Diesmann_et_al_1999.html</a>

The goal of this competition is to extend the set of examples provided to Brian users. It is also an opportunity for you to advertise your papers. The examples will be included in the next Brian release.

Please send me your file with a short explanation before the end of this year (31 December 2011): <a href="mailto:romain.brette@ens.fr">romain.brette@ens.fr</a>

Good luck!</body></html>
