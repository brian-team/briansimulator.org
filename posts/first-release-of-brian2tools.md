<html><body><p>We are happy to announce the release of <strong>brian2tools</strong>. The brian2tools package aims to become a collection of useful tools for simulating spiking neural networks with <em>brian2</em> and for analyzing the results from those simulations. The first 0.1.1 release includes a number of useful functions to plot synaptic connections and variables, multicompartmental morphologies, and the results of simulations (raster plots, rate plots, state variables over time).

For more information, have a look at the documentation: <a href="https://brian2tools.readthedocs.io">brian2tools.readthedocs.io</a>

The package can be installed with anaconda or from source, see the <a href="http://brian2tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html">installation instructions</a> for details.
