<html><body><p>We are happy to announce the release of <strong>Brian 2.1</strong>. This release includes a number of fixes and small improvements, and two new major features: support for numerical integration with adaptive-timestep methods based on the GNU Scientific Library, and caching of code generation leading to faster simulation setup times, in particular for multiple runs of the same model. For an extensive list of changes, see the <a href="http://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.1/introduction/release_notes.html">release notes</a>. We recommend all users of Brian 2 to update.

We also release a new version 1.1. of <a href="http://brian2genn.readthedocs.io"><strong>Brian2GeNN</strong></a>, Brian's interface to the GPU-enhanced Neuronal Network simulation environment (<a href="http://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a>). This release does not contain any major new features except for bug and compatibility fixes, but an update is required for all users that update to Brian 2.1.
