<p>In this paper, we describe a number of examples that showcase various features of Brian 2, ranging from non-standard neuronal/synaptic models to interacting with hardware in real time via C++ code. All the code to run these examples is openly available in a <a href="https://github.com/brian-team/brian2_paper_examples">github repository</a>. <br>The examples are provided as interactive jupyter notebooks, and can be tried out without a local installation of Brian by running them on the <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/brian-team/brian2_paper_examples/master?filepath=index.ipynb">binder infrastructure</a>.</p>
