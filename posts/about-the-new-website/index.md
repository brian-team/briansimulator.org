<html><body><p>The Brian website looks weird! It's not going to last! We have been hacked by some trojan (not the software, just the website) and we had to remove everything. The content is back, but all the settings have gone. It will take a little while to put everything back to the original configuration, please be patient!

<strong>Update: it's back to normal!</strong></p></body></html>
