<html><body><p>As part of the new website, we'll be writing entries on this development blog, showing ideas we plan to put in the next release of Brian. The idea is to let people know about new developments and features, and to get feedback about them. We hope that you might try out experimental or new features available in the experimental subpackage of Brian, or from the most recent revision on the SVN, and let us know what you think about them. Useful questions we would like feedback on are:
</p><ul>
	<li>Does it work?</li>
	<li>Is it too slow?</li>
	<li>Does it have all the features you'd like it to have?</li>
	<li>Is the syntax clear?</li>
</ul>
Brian is an open source package, and partly a community effort. The more feedback and suggestions we get, the better we can make it. Hopefully this blog will also foster efforts to bring more people into the Brian development team.

Please comment on entries on the blog, send us email directly, or join in on the <a href="http://groups.google.fr/group/briansupport">discussion forums</a>.</body></html>
