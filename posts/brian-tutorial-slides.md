<html><body><p>I gave a relatively technical tutorial on using Brian that might be of interest more generally. The tutorial was done via Skype so I could record what I was saying and insert that into the Powerpoint slides. You can download both versions below:

	<li><a href="http://www.briansimulator.org/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/brian-telluride-tutorial-withoutsounds.ppt">Powerpoint slides without audio (1.5MB)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.briansimulator.org/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Telluride-July-2010.zip">Powerpoint slides with audio (15MB)</a></li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, I can't find a good way to convert this into a video file or I would upload that / put it on YouTube - let me know if you have a good, free way of doing it. (None of the programs I found online could correctly handle the transitions and the audio files correctly.)</body></html>
