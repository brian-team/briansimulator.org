In these very particular times, we are nevertheless happy to announce a new release, **Brian 2.4**. This release fixes a large number of bugs and includes a number of small improvements. As announced with the previous release, Brian 2.4 is the first release that no longer supports Python 2. For a full list of changes, see the [release notes](http://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.4/introduction/release_notes.html). We recommend all users of Brian 2 to update.
