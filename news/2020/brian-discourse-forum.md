Ask questions, chat and learn with other Brian users, show off what you've done, suggest new features, ... We will try out a brand new forum for support questions
and general discussion, replacing our previous forums on Google Groups. The new forum builds
on the [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) platform which gives us exciting new features
such as giving credit to users for answering questions.
