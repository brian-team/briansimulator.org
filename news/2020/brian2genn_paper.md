Our paper on [brian2genn](https://brian2genn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) was published today. It automatically translates
Brian models into a format that can be read by the
[GPU-enhanced neural network simulator (GeNN)](https://genn-team.github.io/genn/) to allow it to run on GPU. Some
simulations were 400x faster on GPU compared to a single CPU.
