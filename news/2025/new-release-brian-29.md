We are happy to announce the **Brian 2.9 release**. This release extends the functionality of Brian's *linked variable* feature (in particular, it can now be used to refer to a global modulation term in ``Synapses``), and adds a "graceful interrupt" feature, allowing users to interrupt a simulation with Ctrl+C without triggering the usual Exception.
As usual, the release also fixes a number of bugs and incompatibilities and comes with new examples in its documentation.

For more details, head over to the [release notes](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.9.0/introduction/release_notes.html).

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Brian 2 can be installed with pip from the [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/Brian2/), and via several other means (some of them might take a while to catch up to the latest release). See the [installation instructions](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.9.0/introduction/install.html), and the badges in the [README file](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

Thanks to everyone who contributed ü§ù!
