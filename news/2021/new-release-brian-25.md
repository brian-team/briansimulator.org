It took us a while, but we are very happy to finally announce a new release, **Brian 2.5** üéâ. This release comes with a large number of bug fixes, various small improvements to the C++ code generation process, new examples and improved documentation, as well as a more powerful ‚Äúgenerator syntax‚Äù for synapse generation. In particular, it is now possible to generate a fixed number of synapses randomly ‚Äì either for each pre-synaptic or for each post-synaptic cell. We have also updated our build and testing infrastructure, and now provide binary pip-installable packages for all platforms, including the fancy new Apple hardware. Please let us know if you run into any issues!
