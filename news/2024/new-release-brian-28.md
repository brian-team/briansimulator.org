We are happy to announce the **Brian 2.8 release**. This release fixes a number of small bugs and improves our release infrastructure. In addition, it includes an important performance improvement for random number generation in C++ standalone mode, which significantly speeds up everything that needs randomness (e.g. PoissonGroup). It also comes with the Diehl & Cook (2015) model in the documentation, contributed by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist (thanks!).

For more details, head over to the [release notes](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.8.0/introduction/release_notes.html).

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Brian 2 can be installed with pip from the [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/Brian2/), and via several other means (some of them might take a while to catch up to the latest release).
