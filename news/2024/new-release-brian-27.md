We are happy to announce the releases of **Brian 2.7** and **2.7.1**, together with the compatible CUDA backends **Brian2CUDA 1.0a5** and **1.0a6**. Apart from the usual mix of small improvements and bug fixes, the main new feature is the compatibility with the [numpy 2.0 release](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/2.0.0-notes.html).

For more details, head over to the [release notes](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.7.1/introduction/release_notes.html).

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Brian 2 can be installed with pip from the [pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/Brian2/), and via several other means (some of them might take a while to catch up to the latest release). See the [installation instructions](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/2.7.1/introduction/install.html), and the badges in the [README file](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

Thanks to everyone who contributed ü§ù!
