It's been a while since the last release, so we are very happy to announce that **Brian 2.6** is finally out üéâ This release comes with a major new feature to run standalone simulations repeatedly (or in parallel), without recompiling its code. We now also automatically push Docker images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/briansimulator/brian/general), provide Python wheels for Python 3.12, and build and test on Apple Silicon hardware. The release also fixes various compatibility issues with the upcoming numpy 2.0 release ‚Äì although we cannot be sure yet whether the ongoing development will not make additional changes neccessary. As always, the new release also fixes a bunch of small bugs and errors, and updates the documentation and the examples.

<!-- TEASER_END -->
